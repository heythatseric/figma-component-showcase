|----------|-------------|------|
| `Direction` | The direction in which the component groups will be laid out. | _Horizontal_, Vertical |
| `Levels` | The hierarchy levels in which your components will be organized. | 1 to 100 |
| `Margin` | Distance between each group. | Number in pixels |
| `Gutter` | Distance between each component. | Number in pixels |
| `Display Title` | The parent category name that will be displayed before each group. | _checked_, unchecked |
